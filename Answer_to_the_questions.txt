Here is the answer

1. What did you learn after looking at our dataset?
The dataset appears to contain grayscale images of a parking lot, captured by different cameras and labeled with unique camera IDs and timestamps. Each image is associated with a camera ID. The camera ID helps identify the specific camera that captured the image. The timestamp indicates the time when the image was captured. It provides temporal information about the images.

2. How does your program work?
It starts by importing the necessary libraries for image processing and file operations.
It defines utility functions like draw_color_mask, preprocess_image_change_detection, and compare_frames_change_detection.
The main part of the program starts by collecting a list of image files within the "dataset" directory using glob.glob. 
Creates two folders, essentials_folder and nonessential_folder, if they don't exist.
Creates a copy of the 'dataset' named dataset_folder.copy.
It then iterates over each pair of image files in the dataset using nested loops.
For each pair, it loads and preprocesses the images using preprocess_image_change_detection.
The preprocessed images are then compared using compare_frames_change_detection, which calculates a score based on the difference between the two images.
If the score falls below a specified threshold (200,000 in this case), it implies that the images are similar, and the second image (file2) is moved to 'non-essential' folder. Unique images will be moved to 'essential' folder. 
After comparing all image pairs, it checks if any file was marked as a duplicate. If not, it moves the first file to the essentials_folder.
Logs the status of the file movements. Closes the logger.
